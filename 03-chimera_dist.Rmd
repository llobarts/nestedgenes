# Distances with ChimeraX

UCSF ChimeraX-1.6.1 [@Pettersen2021] includes routines implemented in Python 3.9 that can be leveraged. The objective of this chapter is to obtain a matrix of RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) distances using a ChimeraX tool called MatchMaker. This matrix will be utilized for hierarchical clustering.

## Obtaining RMSD with ChimeraX

Given a list of 29 PDB files, the following code implements automated pairwise comparisons. The code from this initial section should be compiled and saved in a Python file (.py) that can be opened using the 'open' option in the menu bar of the ChimeraX software.

### Import libraries and data

We use the package chimerax, which was previously installed using the pip command. For the pairwise comparison, all the structures in PDB format were saved in the same directory.

```{python chimx-lib, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
import os
from chimerax.core.commands import run

# Directory containing the PDB files
pdb_dir = '/Users/esmeralda/Documents/TFM/article/structures'

# List all PDB files in the directory
pdb_files = [f for f in os.listdir(pdb_dir) if f.endswith('.pdb')]

# Load PDB structures
structures = []
for pdb_file in pdb_files:
    file_path = os.path.join(pdb_dir, pdb_file)
    structure = run(session, "open " + file_path)
    structures.append(structure[0])  # Append the first (and only) structure from the result list
```

### MatchMaker

This step involves configuring various parameters, such as the type of alignment and the weight of secondary structure in the alignment. The names of the structures were formatted according to the chosen PDB file nomenclature type. It's worth noting that the function `run` provides flexibility for users to input any Chimera command, and `session` refers to the current session. In this case, we have opted to save full RMSD values.

```{python chimx-mmker, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# Parameters for MatchMaker alignment
alignment_type = 'Needleman-Wunsch'  # Type of alignment: 'default', 'sequence', 'secondary_structure'
ss_weight = 0.7  # Weight of secondary structure in alignment (0.0 to 1.0)

rmsd_values = []
# Calculate RMSD all-against-all
for i, structure1 in enumerate(structures):
    for j, structure2 in enumerate(structures[i+1:]):
        rmsd_result = run(session, f"matchmaker #{structure2.id_string} to #{structure1.id_string} alg {alignment_type} ssFraction {ss_weight}")
        rmsd_value = rmsd_result[0]
        print(rmsd_value.keys())
        name1 = structure1.name.split('_')[0]
        name2 = structure2.name.split('_')[0]
        
        rmsd_values.append([name1, name2, rmsd_value["full RMSD"]])
```

### Save csv file

The pairwise RMSD values are stored in a CSV file, with one comparison per line.

```{python chimx-save, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# Save RMSD values to CSV file
csv_file = '/Users/esmeralda/Documents/TFM/Chimera_compare/rmsd_values.csv'
with open(csv_file, 'w') as file:
    file.write('Structure 1,Structure 2,RMSD\n')
    for row in rmsd_values:
        file.write(','.join(str(value) for value in row) + '\n')
```

Please remember to close the files. We have completed the data acquisition process in ChimeraX software.

```{python chimx-close, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# Close the structures
for structure in structures:
    run(session, f'close #{structure.id_string}')
```

## Hiarachical clustering

Now that we have the RMSD values in a CSV file, we proceed to construct the matrix of distances in our preferred code editor using the following code.

### Libraries and read csv

```{python chimx-lib2, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage
from scipy.spatial.distance import squareform
from scipy.cluster import hierarchy

# Read node pairs and corresponding distances from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('/Users/esmeralda/Documents/TFM/Chimera_compare/rmsd_values.csv', sep=",")
```

### Create matrix

A matrix as a DataFrame is created using the pandas package.

```{python chimx-matrix, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# Extract unique node labels
nodes = sorted(set(df['Structure 1']).union(df['Structure 2']))

# Create a dictionary to map node labels to matrix indices
node_indices = {node: index for index, node in enumerate(nodes)}

# Initialize the distance matrix as a DataFrame
matrix = pd.DataFrame(index=nodes, columns=nodes)
matrix = matrix.fillna(0.0)

# Assign distances to matrix based on node pairs
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    node1 = row['Structure 1']
    node2 = row['Structure 2']
    distance = row['RMSD']
    matrix.loc[node1, node2] = distance
    matrix.loc[node2, node1] = distance
```

### Plot the clustermap

This function generates a hierarchical clustering plot for the distances using various methods. The cophenetic correlation coefficient serves as a metric to assess their ability to recreate the pairwise distances â€” higher values indicate a better explanation of pairwise relationships.

```{python chimx-plot, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
def plot_rmsd_distances(data, method):

    # Compute a hierarchical clustering
    data_square = squareform(data)
    linkage = hierarchy.linkage(data_square, method=method, optimal_ordering=True)

    # Plot a heatmap with clustered rows and columns
    sns.clustermap(data,
                   method=method,
                   figsize=(8,8),
                   row_linkage=linkage,
                   col_linkage=linkage,
                   cmap="viridis",
                   vmin=0, vmax=25,
                   cbar_pos=(0.02, 0.8225, 0.02, 0.18)
                   )
    # Calculate the cophenetic correlation coefficient
    c, coph_dists = hierarchy.cophenet(linkage, data_square)

    # Print the cophenetic correlation coefficient
    print("Cophenetic correlation coefficient:", c)
  
    # Save in pdf format and show
    plt.savefig("heatmap_structure.pdf", format="pdf", bbox_inches="tight")
    plt.show()
```

We run the preceding function to generate the plot and display the cophenetic correlation coefficient. Examples of methods include `simple`, `average`, `complete` or `centroid`.

```{python chimx-main, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
method = "centroid"
plot_rmsd_distances(matrix, method)
```
