Legarda 2023-11-08 Chapter 1 About This is a code collection that contains the main steps for parsing, processing and visualizing data of the study of the nested genes p19 and p22. Each chapter is a part of the methodology of the study of the overlap of two genes. R, Python and Bash are the languages used for this purpose. Imagen del art√≠culo 1.1 Abstract Viruses with small genomes may encode overlapping or nested open reading frames that increase their coding capacity. The extent by which the constraints upon spatial structures of the two encoded proteins limit the evolvability of nested genes have not been deeply studied. Here, we examined the evolution of the tombusvirus proteins p22 and p19, encoded by nested genes. The structure of p19, the RNA silencing suppressor of the Tombusviridae family, has been determined experimentally; it belongs to the RAGNYA fold from the alpha + beta class. The structure of p22, the cell-to-cell movement protein (MP) from the 30K family common to many families of plant viruses, is not known. AlphaFold structure predictions suggest that the conserved structural core of p22, and of other 30K MPs, has a single jelly-roll fold from the all-beta class, structurally similar to capsid proteins from plant and animal viruses. The sequence and structure conservation within each of the p19 and p22 families coexists with asymmetric selection, mostly negative for p22 but positive for p19. The nucleotide sequence in the alternative reading frames imposes subtle limitations on the types of secondary structures that can be encoded. These limitations arise from specific preferences in the alternative frame due to the interplay of amino acid composition and selection pressures. Thus, the properties of the genetic code and of the encoded amino acid sequences permit the development of compact, well-ordered folds from different structural classes by two similarly-sized nested proteins. An ancient origin of p22 from icosahedral virus capsid protein is likely, whereas p19 may have emerged by stepwise increase in the length of the overprinted gene, acquisition of secondary structure elements by the protein product, and its convergent evolution towards the RAGNYA fold. 1.2 Additional files Some additional files can be found in GitHub.
